This is the front-end implementation of the BOT, the backend is in the Frostburn API repository. (It's not published online)

## Commands

### Start ▶️
To start the server, type 
```
/frostburn vote start
```
When it's activated by two people simultaneously (within the time limit), will request the /command -> start endpoint on our API.

### Stop 🛑

To stop the server, type

```

Only one people is enough to stop the server, so the last one please be kind and halt after you done playing. Let's not waste our server's resources.
